# weather Report





## Description
 for the user to be able to search and it pull up a 5 day weather forecast, and have the recent search results below the search bar
 



## Usage

the user will be able to log and save their daily tasks! The calender will match up to the time of the day and display it at the top. if is it the present hour the section will be red, if the past it will be gray and if its coming up in the future it will be green! i learned in this homework how to grab the time from dayjs and have it equal the id of the hour instead of creating a function for each hour of the day
